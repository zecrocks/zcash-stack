# Docker Zcash Light Wallet

Welcome to the Docker-side of this Zcash node hosting repository. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you came from [class-1-sync](../docs/class-1-sync.md): great!
> If not, don't skip our [workshop overview](../docs/README.md).

## Overview of components

Let's start with an overview of each component in a basic Zcash stack, and a summary of what they do. 

![Block diagram showing the components of basic standard Zcash stack.](../docs/images/block_diagram.png)

In the diagram above, we see several important infrastructure components, including:

- **Core node software**, namely:
    - [*Zebra*](https://zfnd.org/zebra/) is an independent, Rust-based implementation of the Zcash node software, developed by the Zcash Foundation. It is designed for security, correctness, and performance. Zebra fully validates the Zcash blockchain, handles peer-to-peer networking, and implements consensus rules, making it suitable for running validator nodes and contributing to the decentralization and resilience of the Zcash network.
- **Light wallet interface**, such as one of the following:
    - [*Zaino*](https://github.com/zingolabs/zaino) is a lightweight codebase in Go for building Zcash-related infrastructure. Its design emphasizes clear interfaces and extensibility, making it an interface between Zebra node software and lightwallets, auditing services, and other ecosystem tools.
    - [*Lightwalletd*](https://github.com/zcash/lightwalletd) is a backend service that provides a bandwidth-efficient interface to the Zcash blockchain for light wallets and any other client application that needs to interface with the blockchain without storing its entirety locally.
- **Light wallet apps** (clients/user agents), namely:
    - [Zashi](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/) is a self-custody shielded ZEC wallet designed to be run on mobile phones such as Apple's iOS and Google's Android or its derivatives, like [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) and functions as an end user's client application for interacting with the Zcash blockchain and network.
- Some infrastructure for operational considerations, namely:
    - [*Watchtower*](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) is an automated tool for monitoring and updating running Docker containers. It ensures your Zcash node and related services stay up-to-date by automatically pulling and applying new container images with minimal downtime. Updating to the latest version of software releases is an important security best practice.
    - A hosting provider, such as [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/) that provides machine hardware on which node operators host these various server applications. Vultr is just an example. Feel free to use whatever hosting provider suits you, or self-host with your own machine hardware, if you have it.
    - An adminitrator's computer and their SSH connection to the hosting provider. This represents you, a new Zcash node operator!
    - Other node operators, e.g., us and your fellow community members!

## Getting Started

Install Docker on your server/VM and check out this source code repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/zecrocks/zcash-stack.git
cd zcash-stack/docker
```

Adding your donation address to the lighwalletd config:
* in docker-compose.yml about line 53 you'll see: 
```
--donation-address==u14...
```
Change that to your unified sheilded address.
Then bring up the docker container.

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

To run deattached in the background even if ssh connection drops: 
```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --detach
```
To stop the system, but with removing the volumes that get created. 
```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down
```

## Troubleshooting and Docker Down
As happens in life, there are often troubles and times when a clean start is desired. Here are some helpful debugging options for stopping the Docker continers. 

Stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes for this project
```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down -v --remove-orphans
```

Remove all unused containers, networks, images, and volumes
```
docker system prune -a --volumes -f
```

Remove any remaining volumes specifically
```
docker volume prune -f
```

Remove any remaining networks
```
docker network prune -f
```

Restart Docker daemon (optional but can help with network issues)
```
systemctl restart docker
```

All together now! Hard removal of everything.
```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down -v --remove-orphans && docker system prune -a --volumes -f && docker volume prune -f && docker network prune -f
```

## Sync the Blockchain
> [!NOTE] 
> This Docker file will begin to sync the blockchain.

When the Docker containers are started and running properly for the first time, they will begin to sync the blockchain. This means re-verifying each block in the entire chain. As you might imagine, this takes quiet some time. Here too, there are options. 

### Lengthy Process: Let it Run
You could let the containers run, and sync the blockchain as designed. The blockchain will be synced into the ```data``` directory, which can be useful for copying it to other devices.

It will take several days to sync depending on the speed of your computer and internet connection. This is the most secure way of doing it.

### Speedy Process: Download a Snapshot
In a hurry? We host a snapshot of the blockchain that you can download faster than synchronizing it from scratch. It's not the purest way to synchronize, as you are trusting (aka assuming) that this snapshot is accurate, but it can save you over a week, especially if you are on a slow device.

Run the [`download-snapshot.sh`](download-snapshot.sh) first, then bring the Docker Compose configuration of your choosing `up`.

```sh
./download-snapshot.sh                        # Run the script FROM THIS DIRECTORY.
docker compose -f docker-compose.zaino.yml up # The configuration assumes a relative path to the downloaded data.
```
